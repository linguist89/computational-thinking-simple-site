# Problem Solving: Course Introduction

Welcome to the **Problem Solving** course. This exciting and informative course is designed to help you develop essential problem-solving skills that can be applied to a wide range of situations, both in your personal and professional life. The primary aim of this course is to provide you with the tools and methodologies required to effectively understand, analyze, and solve complex problems.

The course will introduce you to four key components of problem solving:

1. **Decomposition**
2. **Pattern Recognition**
3. **Abstraction**
4. **Algorithmic Thinking**

It will delve deep into the essence of these components and illustrate how they intertwine in the process of problem-solving. Real-world applications and examples will be provided to help you grasp the practical relevance and applicability of these skills in various fields, including event planning, building construction, writing a book, product development, and website design.

In addition to these, the course will also discuss how to define real-world problems in terms of their scale, complexity, and impact, and the role problem-solving plays in addressing such issues. This will help you understand how computational thinking and problem-solving methodologies can be utilized to devise effective solutions for a range of real-world problems.

In the subsequent sections, the course will guide you through systematic approaches to problem-solving, detailing how to:

- Break down a problem (Decomposition)
- Recognize patterns in problems and solutions (Pattern Recognition)
- Abstract from specific instances to general principles (Abstraction)
- Design step-by-step solutions using algorithmic thinking (Algorithmic Thinking)

We will also explore the role of algorithms in everyday life, what they...
